            <h3>Ocean</h3>
            <p>
                The ocean is the body of salt water that covers approximately 70.8% of Earth.[8] In English, the term ocean also refers to any of the large bodies of water into which the world ocean is conventionally divided.[9] The following names describe five different areas of the ocean: Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Antarctic/Southern, and Arctic.[10][11] The ocean contains 97% of Earth's water[8] and is the primary component of Earth's hydrosphere; thus the ocean is essential to life on Earth. The ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the carbon cycle, and the water cycle by acting as a huge heat reservoir.
                <br><br>
                Ocean scientists split the ocean into vertical and horizontal zones based on physical and biological conditions. The pelagic zone is the open ocean's water column from the surface to the ocean floor. The water column is further divided into zones based on depth and the amount of light present. The photic zone starts at the surface and is defined to be "the depth at which light intensity is only 1% of the surface value"[12]: 36  (approximately 200 m in the open ocean). This is the zone where photosynthesis can occur. In this process plants and microscopic algae (free floating phytoplankton) use light, water, carbon dioxide, and nutrients to produce organic matter. As a result, the photic zone is the most biodiverse and the source of the food supply which sustains most of the ocean ecosystem. Ocean photosynthesis also produces half of the oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere.[13] Light can only penetrate a few hundred more meters; the rest of the deeper ocean is cold and dark (these zones are called mesopelagic and aphotic zones). The continental shelf is where the ocean meets dry land. It is more shallow, with a depth of a few hundred meters or less. Human activity often has negative impacts on marine life within the continental shelf.

                        The terms "the ocean" or "the sea" used without specification refer to the interconnected body of salt water covering the majority of Earth's surface.[10][11] It includes the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern/Antarctic, and Arctic oceans.[19] As a general term, "the ocean" and "the sea" are often interchangeable.[20]

                        Strictly speaking, a "sea" is a body of water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.[21] The word "sea" can also be used for many specific, much smaller bodies of seawater, such as the North Sea or the Red Sea. There is no sharp distinction between seas and oceans, though generally seas are smaller, and are often partly (as marginal seas) or wholly (as inland seas) bordered by land.[22]

The contemporary concept of the World Ocean was coined in the early 20th century by the Russian oceanographer Yuly Shokalsky to refer to the continuous ocean that covers and encircles most of Earth.[23][24] The global, interconnected body of salt water is sometimes referred to as the World Ocean, global ocean or the great ocean.[25][26][27] The concept of a continuous body of water with relatively unrestricted exchange between its components is critical in oceanography.[28]

                    <h4>Origin of water</h4>
                    <p>
                       Scientists believe that a sizable quantity of water would have been in the material that formed Earth.[31] Water molecules would have escaped Earth's gravity more easily when it was less massive during its formation. This is called atmospheric escape.

                    <h4>Ocean formation</h4>
                    <p>
                        The origin of Earth's oceans is unknown. Oceans are thought to have formed in the Hadean eon and may have been the cause for the emergence of life.

                        Plate tectonics, post-glacial rebound, and sea level rise continually change the coastline and structure of the world ocean. A global ocean has existed in one form or another on Earth for eons.
                        
                        Since its formation the ocean has taken many conditions and shapes with many past ocean divisions and potentially at times covering the whole globe.[41]
                        
                        During colder climatic periods, more ice caps and glaciers form, and enough of the global water supply accumulates as ice to lessen the amounts in other parts of the water cycle. The reverse is true during warm periods. During the last ice age, glaciers covered almost one-third of Earth's land mass with the result being that the oceans were about 122 m (400 ft) lower than today. During the last global "warm spell," about 125,000 years ago, the seas were about 5.5 m (18 ft) higher than they are now. About three million years ago the oceans could have been up to 50 m (165 ft) higher.[42]

                    <p>
                        There are different customs to subdivide the ocean and are adjourned by smaller bodies of water such as, seas, gulfs, bays, bights, and straits.
